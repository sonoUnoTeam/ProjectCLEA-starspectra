This work was born from sonoUno desktop, maintains its principles, and uses some of its libraries.

## Description

This repository contains a script developed as part of the sonoUno project, using three of its modules (data import, data transform, and sound module), exclusively dedicated to performing a multimodal display for the classification of stellar spectra. It is based on the standard spectra obtained from the CLEA Project, currently using three of them: O5V, A5V, and G0V. With the display of the three patterns, the code allows you to input an unknown spectrum and display it multimodally with each of the patterns to facilitate classification.
